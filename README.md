### Navigation & Movement

#### ‚ö° EasyMotion
**Repository**: [easymotion/vim-easymotion](https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion)

Lightning-fast navigation with just a few keystrokes. EasyMotion highlights all possible destinations and allows you to jump directly to any location.

**Basic Usage**:
- `<Leader><Leader>w` - Jump to any word
- `<Leader><Leader>f{char}` - Jump to any character
- `<Leader><Leader>s{char}` - Bidirectional search for character
- `<Leader><Leader>j` - Jump to any line below
- `<Leader><Leader>k` - Jump to any line above

**Examples**:
```vim
" Jump to the word 'function'
<Leader><Leader>wf  " Then press the highlighted letter

" Find all occurrences of 'a'
<Leader><Leader>fa  " Then press the highlighted letter to jump

" Search for 'th' in both directions
<Leader><Leader>sth  " Then press the highlighted letter
```

**Command Mode**:
```vim
" Enable smartcase (match 'v' and 'V' when typing 'v')
let g:EasyMotion_smartcase = 1

" Change the default leader from <Leader><Leader> to <Leader>
map <Leader> <Plug>(easymotion-prefix)
```

#### üëü Sneak
**Repository**: [justinmk/vim-sneak](https://github.com/justinmk/vim-sneak)

Jump to any location specified by two characters. More precise than `f` and works across multiple lines.

**Basic Usage**:
- `s{char}{char}` - Jump to next occurrence of two characters
- `S{char}{char}` - Jump to previous occurrence
- `;` - Repeat last sneak forward
- `,` - Repeat last sneak backward
- `s<Enter>` - Repeat last search

**Examples**:
```vim
" Jump to next 'th'
sth

" Jump to next 'function' by typing 'fu'
sfu

" Delete up to the third occurrence of 'ab'
3dzab

" Search backwards for 'en'
Sen
```

**Command Mode**:
```vim
" Enable label mode (like EasyMotion)
let g:sneak#label = 1

" Replace f with sneak
map f <Plug>Sneak_s
map F <Plug>Sneak_S
```

### Editing & Text Manipulation

#### üí¨ Commentary
**Repository**: [tpope/vim-commentary](https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary)

Easy commenting and uncommenting with simple keystrokes.

**Basic Usage**:
- `gcc` - Toggle comment for current line
- `gc{motion}` - Toggle comment for motion (e.g., `gcap` for paragraph)
- `gc` - Toggle comment for selection (visual mode)

**Examples**:
```vim
" Comment/uncomment current line
gcc

" Comment next 3 lines
gc3j

" Comment a paragraph
gcap

gci)

" Comment from cursor to end of line
gc$
```

**Command Mode**:
```vim
" Comment lines 5-10
:5,10Commentary

" Comment all TODO lines
:g/TODO/Commentary
```

**Uncomment**: All the same commands work for uncommenting - they toggle the comment state.

## üéØ Quick Start Guide

### Most Useful Commands for New Users

1. **Fast Navigation**:
   ```vim
   <Leader><Leader>w    " Jump to any word
   sth                  " Jump to next 'th'
   ```

2. **Quick Commenting**:
   ```vim
   gcc                  " Comment/uncomment line
   gcap                 " Comment/uncomment paragraph
   ```

3. **Efficient Editing**:
   ```vim
   ci"                  " Change inside quotes
   di(                  " Delete inside parentheses
   ```

### Tips for Productivity

- Use relative line numbers: `5j` jumps down 5 lines, `3k` jumps up 3 lines
- Combine motions: `d2w` deletes 2 words, `c3j` changes 3 lines down
- Use EasyMotion for long jumps, Sneak for short precise movements
- Remember that `<Leader>` is typically `\` (backslash)

## üîß Customization

### Changing the Leader Key

By default, `<Leader>` is `\`. You can change it by adding this to the top of your vimrc:

```vim
let mapleader = ","  " Use comma as leader
" or
let mapleader = " "  " Use space as leader
```

### Plugin-specific Configurations

Add these to your vimrc for enhanced functionality:

```vim
" EasyMotion: Use single leader instead of double
map <Leader> <Plug>(easymotion-prefix)

" Sneak: Enable label mode
let g:sneak#label = 1

" EasyMotion: Enable smartcase
let g:EasyMotion_smartcase = 1
```

## üìã Plugin Management

This configuration uses [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) for plugin management.

**Common Commands**:
- `:PlugInstall` - Install plugins
- `:PlugUpdate` - Update all plugins
- `:PlugClean` - Remove unused plugins
- `:PlugStatus` - Check plugin status
