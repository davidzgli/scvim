### Navigation & Movement

#### ‚ö° EasyMotion
**Repository**: [easymotion/vim-easymotion](https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion)

Lightning-fast navigation with just a few keystrokes. EasyMotion highlights all possible destinations and allows you to jump directly to any location.

**Basic Usage**:
- `<space><space>w` - Jump to any word
- `<space><space>f{char}` - Jump to any character
- `<space><space>s{char}` - Bidirectional search for character
- `<space><space>j` - Jump to any line below
- `<space><space>k` - Jump to any line above

**Examples**:
```vim
" Jump to the word 'function'
<space><space>wf  " Then press the highlighted letter

" Find all occurrences of 'a'
<space><space>fa  " Then press the highlighted letter to jump

" Search for 'th' in both directions
<space><space>sth  " Then press the highlighted letter
```

**Command Mode**:
```vim
" Enable smartcase (match 'v' and 'V' when typing 'v')
let g:EasyMotion_smartcase = 1

" Change the default leader from <space><space> to <space>
map <space> <Plug>(easymotion-prefix)
```

#### üëü Sneak
**Repository**: [justinmk/vim-sneak](https://github.com/justinmk/vim-sneak)

Jump to any location specified by two characters. More precise than `f` and works across multiple lines.

**Basic Usage**:
- `s{char}{char}` - Jump to next occurrence of two characters
- `S{char}{char}` - Jump to previous occurrence
- `;` - Repeat last sneak forward
- `,` - Repeat last sneak backward
- `s<Enter>` - Repeat last search

**Examples**:
```vim
" Jump to next 'th'
sth

" Jump to next 'function' by typing 'fu'
sfu

" Delete up to the third occurrence of 'ab'
3dzab

" Search backwards for 'en'
Sen
```

**Command Mode**:
```vim
" Enable label mode (like EasyMotion)
let g:sneak#label = 1

" Replace f with sneak
map f <Plug>Sneak_s
map F <Plug>Sneak_S
```

### Editing & Text Manipulation

#### üí¨ Commentary
**Repository**: [tpope/vim-commentary](https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary)

Easy commenting and uncommenting with simple keystrokes.

**Basic Usage**:

**Examples**:
```vim
" Comment/uncomment current line
gcc

gc$
```

**Command Mode**:
```vim
" Comment lines 5-10
:5,10Commentary

" Comment all TODO lines
:g/TODO/Commentary
```

**Uncomment**: All the same commands work for uncommenting - they toggle the comment state.

- `:VimuxRunLastCommand` - Re-execute the most recent command
- `:VimuxCloseRunner` - Close the tmux runner pane
- `:VimuxInspectRunner` - Move cursor to tmux runner pane

**Key Mappings** (using spacebar as leader):
- `<space>vl` - Run current line in tmux pane
- `[count]<space>vj` - Run current line + count lines below (default: 3)
- `[count]<space>vk` - Run current line + count lines above (default: 3)
- `[count]<space>va` - Run current line + count lines above and below (default: 3)
- `<space>vp` - Run current paragraph (blank line separated)
- `<space>vv` - Run visual selection (visual mode)
- `<space>vr` - Re-run last command
- `<space>vc` - Close tmux runner pane
- `<space>vi` - Inspect tmux runner pane

**Examples**:
```vim
" Run a system command
:VimuxRunCommand "systemctl status nginx"

" Monitor log files
:VimuxRunCommand "tail -f /var/log/syslog"

" Run a script and keep it visible
:VimuxRunCommand "./deploy.sh"

" Re-run the last command
:VimuxRunLastCommand

" Interactive usage examples:
" 1. Place cursor on 'ls -la' and press <space>vl
" 2. Select multiple commands and press <space>vv
" 3. Use 4<space>vj to run current line + 4 below
" 4. Use 2<space>va to run current line + 2 above and below
" 5. Use <space>vp to run entire script block
```

**Useful for System Administrators**:
- Running diagnostic commands while editing configs
- Monitoring services during configuration changes
- Testing scripts without leaving the editor
- Quick access to system logs and status

**Requirements**: Requires tmux to be installed and running.

## üéØ Quick Start Guide

### Most Useful Commands for New Users

1. **Fast Navigation**:
   ```vim
   <space><space>w      " Jump to any word
   sth                  " Jump to next 'th'
   ```

2. **Quick Commenting**:
   ```vim
   gcc                  " Comment/uncomment line
   gcap                 " Comment/uncomment paragraph
   ```

3. **Terminal Integration**:
   ```vim
   <space>vl            " Run current line in tmux
   4<space>vj           " Run current + 4 lines below
   <space>vp            " Run current paragraph in tmux
   <space>vr            " Re-run last command
   ```

4. **Efficient Editing**:
   ```vim
   ci"                  " Change inside quotes
   di(                  " Delete inside parentheses
   ```

### Tips for Productivity

- Use relative line numbers: `5j` jumps down 5 lines, `3k` jumps up 3 lines
- Combine motions: `d2w` deletes 2 words, `c3j` changes 3 lines down
- Use EasyMotion for long jumps, Sneak for short precise movements
- `<Leader>` is set to spacebar for easy access

## üîß Customization

### Leader Key Configuration

The leader key is set to spacebar for easy access. This configuration is already included in the vimrc:

```vim
let mapleader = " "  " Spacebar as leader key
```

You can change it to other keys if preferred:

```vim
let mapleader = ","  " Use comma as leader
let mapleader = ";"  " Use semicolon as leader
```

### Plugin-specific Configurations

Add these to your vimrc for enhanced functionality:

```vim
" EasyMotion: Use single leader instead of double
map <space> <Plug>(easymotion-prefix)

" Sneak: Enable label mode
let g:sneak#label = 1

" EasyMotion: Enable smartcase
let g:EasyMotion_smartcase = 1

" Additional key mappings
inoremap jk <Esc>    " Alternative to jj for exiting insert mode
```

## üìã Plugin Management

This configuration uses [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) for plugin management.

**Common Commands**:
- `:PlugInstall` - Install plugins
- `:PlugUpdate` - Update all plugins
- `:PlugClean` - Remove unused plugins
- `:PlugStatus` - Check plugin status

## üÜò Getting Help

- `:help easymotion` - EasyMotion documentation
- `:help sneak` - Sneak documentation
- `:help commentary` - Commentary documentation
- `:help airline` - Airline documentation

## ü§ù Contributing
